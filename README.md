# CodeSnap
This project aims to create efficient, small snapshots of repositories to use as checkpoints or to share.

## Concepts
### RAW snap
A snap with all the content needed to replicate the original repository.

### RELative snap
A snap that contains the changes against another related snap of the same repository (created as a diff).
